  uu_respawn.2.desc:0 "The news of the death of Jean Bureau, France's beloved inventor and artillery specialist, saddened many who believed that his expertise held the key to driving the English off of French soil for good. Rumours of his death spread across the region, from an illness, to a cannon misfire, to a stray arrow, to even a malicious English plot to murder him. However, it seems the reports were either fictitious or exaggerated, for Jean Bureau made a surprise return to [Root.Capital.GetName] this morning. It seems he spent a short spell in a sanatorium recovering, where he was apparently visited by Jeanne d'Arc herself and a plethora of saints who encouraged him to make a full recovery. After this, he reportedly travelled to the capital disguised and under cover of darkness, fighting bandits and evading the English, finally arriving here to serve as commander once more. It seems like just as the strongest English fortification is no match for Bureau's bombards, even the most dastardly English plot was no match for Bureau's plot armor."

He served [Root.GetName] for many years, winning numerous sieges and battles, being ennobled and knighted in 1461, and even supposedly cheating death. Historians will surely remember him as one of the greatest French military leaders of the modern era."

 uu_flavor_tim.0.d:0 "The aging ruler of the Timurid Empire, Shah Rukh, has been ill since the beginning of 1444. In his absence his wife, Goharshad, had taken over the daily rule of the empire but this sign of weakness has set wheels in motion among Shah Rukh's sons and grandsons who rule the Timurid provinces.\n\nIn the north, Shah Rukh's eldest son Ulugh Beg, a famous astronomer and skilled mathematician, governs the whole of Transoxiana. This territory is the largest of the Timurid holdings, including Timur's old capital of Samarkand.\n\nIn the west rule the sons of Shah Rukh's third son Baysonqor. Both Babur of Khorasan and Muhammad of Ajam are opportunistic and ambitious potential claimants. Muhammad already boldly flaunts the authority of Shah Rukh, accepting taxes and tokens of loyalty from a much larger region than his assigned governorate, drawing the ire of Shah Rukh.\n\nIn the east, the sons of Shah Rukh's fourth son Soyurghatmish control the highlands of Afghanistan.\n\nIn the southeast the province of Fars is ruled by a regent on behalf of the young Abdallah, inherited from his late father Ibrahim second son of Shah Rukh.\n\nShah Rukh is clearly an old man, and it seems all but inevitable that a second Timurid civil war occurs on his death. Shah Rukh himself secured the empire by eliminating his rival claimants, and every Timurid heir knows that if they are to keep the empire intact, their task is the same."
