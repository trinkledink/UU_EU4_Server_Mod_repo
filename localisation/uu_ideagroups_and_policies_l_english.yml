  uuideagroups.20.d:0 "It seems one of our military academies' class of new graduates have developed a reputation for being particularly innovative in the art of commanding their troops. It is surely a result of our focus on the training of our officers that this genius could be cultivated and spread."
  uuideagroups.20.a:0 "I am excited to see what leaders they will make."
 uuideagroups.21.t:0 "A Peculiar Candidate?"
  uuideagroups.21.d:0 "Average grades, mediocre performance, no good references. It would seem that by all accounts, the system had failed this individual, except in the matter of siegecraft which they seem to have been exceptionally talented at, even earning the praise of some of the country's most respected military personnel. That being said, it would be rare indeed that an individual so unqualified in the conventional matters of leadership would be promoted to a full general, but perhaps his rare skill demands exception."

 uuideagroups.24.t:0 "New Quartermaster"

  uuideagroups.24.a:0 "They will make an excellent quartermaster."
 uuideagroups.25.t:0 "An Exceptional Admiralty"
  uuideagroups.25.d:0 "Our naval cadets are like no others, every sailor in [Root.Capital.GetContinentName] knows that the [Root.GetName] Navigation School produces the world's finest naval commanders. The training is top-notch, and most of the instructors are also famous themselves."

 uuideagroups.26.t:0 "A Logistical Nightmare"
  uuideagroups.26.d:0 "It is said that no plan survives first contact with the enemy.

 uuideagroups.27.t:0 "Stubborn Veterans"
  uuideagroups.27.d:0 "Our policy of employing veterans as instructors in our army seems to have backfired, as many of them refuse to accept the changing of the times and insist on using tactics that have since become outdated. Any attempt to even slightly modernize the system is now met with stubborn resistance from those same men who were once national heroes."
  uuideagroups.27.a:0 "Well we did hire them for a reason, right?" 
  uuideagroups.27.b:0 "See if you can find a way to fire them without causing a popular revolt."
 uuideagroups.28.t:0 "Treason from the General Staff"
  uuideagroups.28.d:0 "Our officers are renowned for their training and expertise, but this also makes them prime targets for headhunting by operatives from other countries. It seems one important member of our staff has taken up employment with our rivals, where he now enjoys a much higher salary and relative fame."
  uuideagroups.28.a:0 "This only proves that our army was better than theirs."
