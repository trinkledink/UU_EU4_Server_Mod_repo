 uufulojihad.1.t:0 "An Islamic Revolution in [Root.GetName]"  
  uufulojihad.1.d:0 "It seems the Fulani preachers that we cast out never lost their resolve, nor their followers. Gathered behind their leader Usman Dan Fodio, the most prominent of the preachers and a respected Islamic scholar in his own right, they have begun to actively oppose our regime and have declared a Jihad to overthrow our leaders. We have faced troubles before, but these incredibly popular leaders have gathered a large portion of our realm behind them. This is shaping up to be a rebellion on a scale we have never seen."
  uufulojihad.1.a:0 "The Sokoto Caliphate is born this day."
  uufulojihad.1.b:0 "Death to the zealot rebels!"
 uufulojihad.2.t:0 "The Caliphate of Massina"
  uufulojihad.2.d:0 "It seems the Fulani preachers that we cast out never lost their resolve, nor their followers. Gathered behind their leader Sheikhu Ahmadu, the most prominent of the preachers and a respected Islamic scholar in his own right, they have begun to actively oppose our regime and have declared a Jihad to overthrow our leaders. We have faced troubles before, but these incredibly popular leaders have gathered a large portion of our realm behind them. This is shaping up to be a rebellion on a scale we have never seen."
  uufulojihad.2.a:0 "The Massina will see prosperity again."
  uufulojihad.2.b:0 "Death to the zealot rebels!"
 uufulojihad.3.t:0 "Islamic Revolution in Fouta Tooro"
  uufulojihad.3.d:0 "It seems the Fulani people themselves have not taken kindly to our persecution of their preachers. Gathered behind a local leader, they decry our pagan practices and declare that the Fulani people have been subject to impious rulers for too long, and have risen up in revolt against us to declare a new theocratic state. We have faced troubles before, but these incredibly popular leaders have gathered a large portion of our realm behind them. This is shaping up to be a rebellion on a scale we have never seen."
  uufulojihad.3.a:0 "The Fulani deserve a true Muslim leader."

 uufulojihad.10.t:0 "An Islamic Revolution?"
  uufulojihad.10.d:0 "In recent times, the monarchical rule of our dynasty has proved a little overbearing for our subjects. The Fulani people have prided themselves on being among the first Muslim converts in West Africa, but it is no secret that of late our rule has been somewhat lacking in the piety department. A movement has begun to replace the ruling dynasty with a theocratic Islamized regime, in the hopes that a more proper Islamic leadership will lead us to prosperous times once again."
  uufulojihad.10.a:0 "They might have a point."
  uufulojihad.10.b:0 "They may have my throne over my dead body."
 uufulojihad.40.t:0 "Fulani Preachers"
  uufulojihad.40.d:0 "Originating from the Tekrur area in the northwestern Sahel, the Fulani people have migrated eastward in recent centuries to settle in Hausaland, Borno, and beyond. The migrations consisted mainly of pastoralists who brought with them their cattle but adopted local languages. That being said, they pride themselves on being one of the first groups in Western Africa to convert to Islam, and many Fulani are active in promoting the spread of Islam in the region.\n\nRecently, a Fulani scholar of Islam in [Root.Capital.GetName] has begun preaching within our lands, advocating not only for conversion of non-Muslims but critiquing existing Muslim elites for their perceived violations of Islamic law. This preacher has since become very popular within our country, and a movement for social reform has begun to amass around him."
  uufulojihad.40.a:0 "We should hear what he has to say."
  uufulojihad.40.b:0 "This activity will only cause problems for [Root.GetName]."

 flavor_mal.0.d:0 "After the death of Mansa Suleyman Keita, the brother of the mighty Mansa Musa, the empire of Mali has seen a constant decline in power, influence and wealth over the decades. Civil wars, fights for the thrones and a series of incompetent mansas undermined the stability of Mali. Former subjects such as the Songhai or the Timbuktu declared their independence from the empire, and even now the realm is seeing further and further fall in importance."

 uu_kitara.4.d:0 "The shift from a more rural population into a more urban one has opened up some new possiblities. The cities in our realm produce and trade more than ever before. We could steer this process and benefit the production of certain goods over others if we wish."
