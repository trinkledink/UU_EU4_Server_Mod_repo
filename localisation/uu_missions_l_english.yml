Our distinct identity has been a source of national pride, and to that end we have successfully managed to defy assimilation and preserve our unique culture, despite extensive dealings with the Germans. That being said, what was once almost exclusively a realm of Czechs has now expanded to include a sizeable population of Germans. With our recent confederation with the like-minded neighbouring Saxon states, our 'distinct' identity has become more dilute with every passing year. The question now arises with increasing frequency whether now is the time to finally begin the process of assimilating, if only to gain favour with our increasingly large German minority. However, this risks alienating many traditional Czechs who will see this as the first step towards the final death of Czech independence."

That being said, our recent confederation of the Bohemian lands into not just a union of two kingdoms, but a unified centralized state of equals, means that the two cultures have begun to intermingle and blend in a way they never have before. The question now arises with increasing frequency whether now is the time to finally begin the process of assimilating, to finally bring the lands of Bohemia into the German fold. However, with the vast German majority sure to cause more influence on the Czechs than vice versa, this risks alienating many traditional Czechs who will see this as the first step towards the final death of Czech independence."

 uu_spa_discover_new_colonies_title:0 "Discover New Colonies"
  uu_spa_discover_new_colonies_desc:0 "Our explorers en route to India have returned with tales of vast unclaimed lands out there for the taking. We must survey these potential findings to see if any are worth setting up permanent bases in."
 uu_spa_tordesillas_title:0 "Treaty of Tordesillas"
  uu_spa_tordesillas_desc:0 "Though we have managed to stabilize our realm and our relationship with the Kingdom of Portugal, a haphazard colonization plan will undoubtedly lead to territorial disputes and unnecessary tension with our closest neighbour. Let us formalize our spheres of influence in the wider world, so that we can grow our empires unperturbed by each other."
 uu_spa_reconquista_granada_title:0 "Reclaim Andalucia"

 uu_spa_acquire_bullion_title:0 "Gold in Tafilalt"
  uu_spa_acquire_bullion_desc:0 "The 15th century saw large-scale shortages of precious metals throughout Europe, as outflow of gold and silver to the East outpaced production from mines. Our recent gains in Africa mean that we are in a strong position to seize the gold mines at Tafilalt, and secure another supply of precious metals for our mints."
 uu_spa_turk_holy_league_title:0 "The 1571 Holy League"
  uu_spa_turk_holy_league_desc:0 "A new heathen threat rises in the Eastern mediterranean, and actively makes attacks on Christendom's merchants.

 uu_spa_spanish_armada_title:0 "Spanish Armada"
  uu_spa_spanish_armada_desc:0 "The British isles have become a hotbed for heretic activity, insulated from the rest of Europe.

  uu_spa_weather_civil_war_desc:0 "Before we take any more measures to expand our realm, we must first deal with the growing troubles within. Our Kings have been weak, and our line of succession questionable. If our realm is to not fall to pieces, we must ensure there is no question of who the rightful monarch is, one way or another."
 uu_spa_navarra_title:0 "Subjugate Navarra"

  uu_spa_protectors_of_the_western_med_desc:0 "As our trade dominance grows, more and more merchants look to us for protection from the reaving pirates.

 uu_spa_aragon_title:0 "Claims in Aragon"
  uu_spa_aragon_desc:0 "The Crowns of Aragon and Castile historically have had very close dynastic ties, but this has also led to their nobility meddling in our internal politics to the point of causing civil wars. We must curtail the power of these nobles one way or another."
 uu_spa_trastamara_domain_title:0 "Trastamara Domains"
  uu_spa_trastamara_domain_desc:0 "The Kingdoms of Sicily and Naples were periodically ruled by Aragonese kings in the preceding centuries, and most recently captured by Alfons 'The Magnificent' of Trastamara in the mid-1400s. However, he chose to split his realm and leave Naples to his illegitimate son in his will. Alfons was a fool, and with our recent consolidation of the holdings of House Trastamara, Sicily and Naples are simply natural extensions of this policy."
 uu_spa_control_pope_title:0 "A Loyal Papacy"
  uu_spa_control_pope_desc:0 "Though we are one of the foremost Catholic states, His Holiness in Rome is not always recognizing of our efforts. Let us rectify that by ensuring he knows full well our abilities to defend Christianity."
 uu_spa_intervene_in_italy_title:0 "Intervene in Italy"
  uu_spa_intervene_in_italy_desc:0 "The Italian peninsula, long disunited, has become a diplomatic skirmishing ground for the other major European powers. We must take measures to curb their influence in the region, and extend our own networks there instead."
 uu_spa_embrace_counter_reformation_title:0 "Fight the Reformation"
  uu_spa_embrace_counter_reformation_desc:0 "A new war against God is being waged in Europe, this time by fellow Christ-adherents. This heretical nonsense has no place in [Root.GetName], and to prove our devoutness we will formally join the war against the heresy. The Lord knows those who are His!"
 uu_spa_win_league_war_title:0 "Win the League War"
  uu_spa_win_league_war_desc:0 "Having dealt with the Protestants domestically, we must now take the fight to their strongholds in Germany. We must cleanse the so-called 'Holy' Empire of the Germans and reestablish Catholicism as the one true faith in Europe."

  uu_spa_catholic_monarchy_pogchamp_desc:0 "The faithful adore us. The heretics fear us. The pope has blessed us. We are truly deserving to be called the Catholic Monarchy, as no other Catholic kingdom is as pious or has done enough to fight heresy as we have."

 uu_spa_found_havana_title:0 "Found Havana"

 uu_spa_new_spain_title:0 "The First Viceroyalty"
  uu_spa_new_spain_desc:0 "As we crush the frail empires of Mexico, a new system of administration is required to manage the large amounts of land we have conquered here.

 uu_spa_california_title:0 "Colonize California"

 #Events
 uu_spa_events.1.t:0 "The Question of Portugal"
  uu_spa_events.1.desc:0 "From our shared origins fighting back-to-back against the Moorish invaders, to the Treaty of Alcanizes in 1297, our kingdom and the Portuguese kingdom have historically been on good terms. However, as with Aragon, supporters of Portugal in our realm have been interfering with our domestic politics, with pretenders to our throne even gaining support from sympathetic Portuguese allies. As the Reconquista draws to a close, the bonds holding our kingdoms together as allies is weakening. It is now time for us to choose whether our closeness with Portugal is worth the trouble it can bring, or if our kingdoms can continue to prosper in friendship and alliance forever more."
  uu_spa_events.1.a:0 "Let us continue the fight against the infidels together, as the best of allies."
  uu_spa_events.1.b:0 "Portugal is nothing more than a future subject."
 uu_spa_events.2.t:0 "Naval Dominance Lost!"
  uu_spa_events.2.desc:0 "The Iberian brutes have utterly destroyed our proud fleets in recent conflicts. Though once all the Christians of the Mediterranean feared the African reaver, they mock us now from behind the wooden wall of the Spanish fleets. This seems to have affected our sailors too, as now no one wants to go on slave raids or enlist in the navy for fear of ending up at the bottom of the sea, or worse captured and tortured by the ever-present hostile fleets."
  uu_spa_events.2.a:0 "How will we rebuild our navy, if no one is even willing to try?"
 uu_spa_events.3.t:0 "The Desolation of Tenochtitlan"
  uu_spa_events.3.desc:0 "In the aftermath of the Spanish conquest of Tenochtitlan, the once-great city rivalling Paris and Constantinople was practically razed to the ground. The siege led to widespread famine and plague, and the ensuing plunder of the city spared neither soldier nor civilian as houses were emptied of goods and palaces despoiled for treasure. Nonetheless, as the former capital of the Aztec Empire situated in the middle of a lake, the location remains both strategically and symbolically significant. Our conquistador in charge of the victorious army, whether out of remorse or simply ambition, has put forward a proposal to rebuild the city in the Spanish style, and thus found a new capital city from which our colony can be ruled. However, looking out at the hellscape before them and the sheer amount of damage wrought upon the site, it is hard for any to even imagine how it might look like..."
  uu_spa_events.3.a:0 "Forge ahead with the construction, this city will be the heart of New Spain."
  uu_spa_events.3.b:0 "There's nothing of value left for us here. Just gather the loot lying around and go."
 uu_spa_events.4.t:0 "The Moroccans Defeated"
  uu_spa_events.4.desc:0 "The Kingdom of Morocco was at last conquered. The last Sultan was captured and taken into custody last month, where he remains as merely another prisoner. Instead of symbols of the false god and heathen kingdoms which fly from the mosques and kasbahs of the Atlas mountains, there now triumphantly stand crosses and [Root.GetAdjective] flags. With this final victory, we have proved to both our own citizens and to the other Muslim powers that Iberia is at last safe from Muslim aggression. The Reconquista is over, and there will never again be a need for another. \n\nHowever, amidst the celebration, important matters remain still to be attended to. The Moroccans are unlikely to remain pacified, and we must quickly decide by what means we will administrate this newly-conquered territory and keep it stable without emptying the royal Treasury."
  uu_spa_events.4.a:0 "Establish a puppet state under a local elder to rule Morocco for us."

  uu_spa_events.999.desc:0 "The Treaty of Tordesillas was signed in Tordesillas, Spain on 7 June 1494 and authenticated in Setúbal, Portugal. It formally divided the newly discovered lands outside Europe into two spheres of influence along a meridian 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde islands, off the west coast of Africa. The lands to the east would belong to Portugal and the lands to the west to Castile. The treaty ensured the two colonial powers could remain relatively friendly with each other, instead of becoming rivals competing for similar areas."

That success can be attributed to the great dedication of Heinrich Rugenow, mayor of Greifswald, and the efforts of Warcislaw the Ninth, the at-the-time Duke of Wolgast-Pomerania. Thanks to the ties the city had with the Hanseatic League, the University managed to bring together many great minds not just from Northern Germany, but also from Scandinavia.

That has lead to the Landtag in Treptow, a meeting that would decide the future of the Pomeranian Duchy. The Landtag took place in December of 1534 and estates of the realm were called in to participate. In favor of embracing protestantism were the burghers, which were at odds with the clergy, and the rulers of Pomerania, who saw the protestant reformation as an opportunity to secularize and thus seize the lands of bishops and monasteries. On the opposing side were the nobles and the clergy, both of which preferred Pomerania stayed in unity with rome. The opposition was lead by the Bishop of Cammin, Erasmus von Manteuffel-Arnhausen. Despite the fierce resistance, the dukes of Pomerania adopted Protestantism and publicly announced their conversion. This marked the beginning of the creation of Pomeranian Evangelical Church."

Currently it is the subject of the squabbles between the Teutonic Knights and the Polish Crown, perhaps it's time to enforce our sovereignty upon these territories. While these territories are more slavic, the German urban population and the large maritime cities don't make these lands all that different from Pomerania itself."
