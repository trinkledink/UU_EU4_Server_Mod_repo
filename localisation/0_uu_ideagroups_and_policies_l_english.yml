 uu_mercenary_ideas.3.b:0 "We fight for Honour"
 uu_mercenary_ideas.name4:0 "Mercenaries demand Payment"
 uu_mercenary_ideas.desc4:0 "It appears that after recent conflicts, the men supposed to pay the hired arms all ran off with the money. Now the slightly uppity mercenaries are knocking on the door, demanding their cash in hand."

 uu_mercenary_ideas.name8:0 "Mercenary Pools Drained"
 uu_mercenary_ideas.desc8:0 "The war exhaustion has affected not only our economy, but the number of men willing to fight for us. Anywhere we look, there are no more men willing to pick up their weapons and go to war for our cause."

 uu_mercenary_ideas.name9:0 "Seizing the Coffers"
 uu_mercenary_ideas.desc9:0 "With recent victories, certain mercenaries have made themselves wealthy on the spoils of our wars.

 uu_mercenary_ideas.11.b:0 "We need you as a general"

 uuideagroups.20.t:0 "The Officer Class of [GetYear]"
  uuideagroups.20.d:0 "It seems one of our military academies' class of new graduates have developed a reputation for being particularly innovative in the art of commanding their troops. It is surely a result of our focus on the training of our officers that this genius could be cultivated and spread."
  uuideagroups.20.a:0 "I am excited to see what leaders they will make."
 uuideagroups.21.t:0 "A Peculiar Candidate?"
  uuideagroups.21.d:0 "Average grades, mediocre performance, no good references. It would seem that by all accounts, the system had failed this individual, except in the matter of siegecraft which they seem to have been exceptionally talented at, even earning the praise of some of the country's most respected military personnel. That being said, it would be rare indeed that an individual so unqualified in the conventional matters of leadership would be promoted to a full general, but perhaps his rare skill demands exception."
  uuideagroups.21.a:0 "His skills are what we need right now."
  uuideagroups.21.a.tt:0 "This general will have their §YSiege skill§! modified by §J4§!."
  uuideagroups.21.b:0 "I would prefer to promote a more reliable candidate."
 uuideagroups.22.t:0 "A Successful System Test"
  uuideagroups.22.d:0 "War is always harsh on our men, but after the recent battles it has become clear that the command structure of our armies was especially well adapted to the times. Many of our men felt that their leadership was effective and was capable of managing them effectively, and this has resulted in a stronger sense of trust in our general staff."
  uuideagroups.22.a:0 "Battles are not won by strength alone."
 uuideagroups.23.t:0 "An Army with a Backbone"
  uuideagroups.23.d:0 "Our army of soldiers is supported by another army of support personnel altogether. The robust machine that is our military stands ready to spring to action whenever necessary, and both our and their soldiers know it."
  uuideagroups.23.a:0 "Our troops can be confident in their leaders."
 uuideagroups.24.t:0 "New Quartermaster"
  uuideagroups.24.d:0 "Not all who go through our officer training processes become great generals. Many go on to play equally important roles supporting the army from headquarters, and our country puts great emphasis on this latter role. One individual in particular shows real promise."
  uuideagroups.24.a:0 "They will make an excellent quartermaster."
 uuideagroups.25.t:0 "An Exceptional Admiralty"
  uuideagroups.25.d:0 "Our naval cadets are like no others, every sailor in [Root.Capital.GetContinentName] knows that the [Root.GetName] Navigation School produces the world's finest naval commanders. The training is top-notch, and most of the instructors are also famous themselves."
  uuideagroups.25.a:0 "This may be a golden era for the [Root.GetAdjective] Admiralty."
 uuideagroups.26.t:0 "A Logistical Nightmare"
  uuideagroups.26.d:0 "It is said that no plan survives first contact with the enemy. Certainly ours did not, as the latest debacles in military headquarters have thrown our army and its organization into disarray. Many soldiers find it difficult to pass information up through increasing bureaucracy created by our expanding system, and our leaders feel overburdened by the extra responsibilities."
  uuideagroups.26.a:0 "We will have to go back to the drawing board for now."
 uuideagroups.27.t:0 "Stubborn Veterans"
  uuideagroups.27.d:0 "Our policy of employing veterans as instructors in our army seems to have backfired, as many of them refuse to accept the changing of the times and insist on using tactics that have since become outdated. Any attempt to even slightly modernize the system is now met with stubborn resistance from those same men who were once national heroes."
  uuideagroups.27.a:0 "Well we did hire them for a reason, right?" 
  uuideagroups.27.b:0 "See if you can find a way to fire them without causing a popular revolt."
 uuideagroups.28.t:0 "Treason from the General Staff"
  uuideagroups.28.d:0 "Our officers are renowned for their training and expertise, but this also makes them prime targets for headhunting by operatives from other countries. It seems one important member of our staff has taken up employment with our rivals, where he now enjoys a much higher salary and relative fame."
  uuideagroups.28.a:0 "This only proves that our army was better than theirs."
