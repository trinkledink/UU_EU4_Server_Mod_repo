 flavor_mng.28.d:1 "The Censorate is a highly effective and influential branch of our government. Under the direct authority of the Emperor, its primary role is to extend the authority and vigilance of the Emperor to all the branches of administration, providing detailed reports on the palatial conduct of various bureaucrats, exposing corruption and serving as a strong moral compass.

It is the dawn of a new age, as the multicultural society of this domain is naturally pushed towards progress due to the mixture of very different traditions that has occurred." #UU Modded
